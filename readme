v1.1
Config has completely changed - if updating, please delete your current one and let the new one automatically generate when you restart.
Added variables and color codes to the config, use %name% and %number%.
Added ability to use standard color codes throughout all messages as much as you wish.
Added options to disable the first join messages, join messages, and kick messages.
Added option to display the unique amount of players in total that have joined.
Added ability to give players who join for the first time a configurable item (use the data value for the item). Amount is the amount of that item to give, and data is the data/damage value of it (used for colored wool etc., normally left at 0).

v1.0
Initial Release.
