FirstJoinPlus v1.2
http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/firstjoinplus/

v1.2
If updating, please delete your config file and let a new one generate.
Added a /fjp alias (you can now use that instead of /firstjoinplus for all commands).
Added the ability to set a first join spawnpoint with /firstjoinplus setspawn. Teleport to it with /firstjoinplus spawn.
Added support to define multiple first join items (in the format of "itemid.amount.datavalue" - e.x. "57.32.0" would give you 32 diamond blocks).
Added ability to create a first join MOTD (display a custom message to players on their first join).
Added "onlyfirstjoin" config option to force the plugin to *only* deal with things related to first joining (this will disable things such as the custom join messages).
Added ability to use the %number% variable in the first join message.
Added "numberonfirstjoin" config option to make the number of unique players show only on first join and not on every join.
Added support to show the player's display name instead of their username in all messages.
Added support for other chat plugins to handle the join/leave/kick messages (if those options are disabled).
Fixed the /firstjoinplus reload command (it works now!).
Fixed the blank "ghost lines" from showing if join/leave/kick messages were disabled.

Code cleanup!

v1.1
Config has completely changed - if updating, please delete your current one and let the new one automatically generate when you restart.
Added variables and color codes to the config, use %name% and %number%.
Added ability to use standard color codes throughout all messages as much as you wish.
Added options to disable the first join messages, join messages, and kick messages.
Added option to display the unique amount of players in total that have joined.
Added ability to give players who join for the first time a configurable item (use the data value for the item). Amount is the amount of that item to give, and data is the data/damage value of it (used for colored wool etc., normally left at 0).

v1.0
Initial Release.
