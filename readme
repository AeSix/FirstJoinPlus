FirstJoinPlus v1.6
http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/firstjoinplus/

Added firstjoinplus.notify permission. When a player joins for the first time, players with that permissions will hear a sound effect.
Added console-commands section to the configuration - run console commands when a player joins for the first time!
Added variables to the commands and console-commands section(s) so you can use %name%, %displayname%, %number%, and the other GeoIPTools variables.
Fixed setting "none" to leave/join/kick messages not working to disable them.
Fixed various other small things.
Built with the latest RB, guarantees Craftbukkit 1.4.2-R0.1 (and higher) compatibility.

v1.5
Major code refactoring and cleanup.
Added FirstJoinEvent for developers (though useless as the Bukkit API has the ability to check).

Added console support for commands not requiring a player.
Added permissions to all the commands (they'll still default to OP's though - find the permissions on the plugin's page).
Fixed first join spawning not being very exact (you'll now spawn in the middle of the block instead of on the edge).
Fixed various other things (commands are now a lot more usable, for example).
Built with the latest RB, guarantees compatibility (this is not dead!).

Fixed some little things here and there.

Fixed setting the first join spawnpoint in a different world.

Added support to define multiple first join items (in the format of "itemid.amount.datavalue" - e.x. "57.32.0" would give you 32 diamond blocks).
Added ability to create a first join MOTD (display a custom message to players on their first join).
Added "onlyfirstjoin" config option to force the plugin to *only* deal with things related to first joining (this will disable things such as the custom join messages).
